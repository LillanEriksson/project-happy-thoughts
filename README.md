A twitter-like page to practice fetching and posting to API in react.

## The problem

I started with sketching out the components and what roles they should have in posting and fetching data. Then I created the components and did the first fetch to get the messages to show.
After that I did most of the css-part, then I got the POST-fetch and the like-function to work.
