# Happy Thoughts

A twitter-like page to practice fetching and posting to API in react.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started with sketching out the components and what roles they should have in posting and fetching data. Then I created the components and did the first fetch to get the messages to show.
After that I did most of the css-part, then I got the POST-fetch and the like-function to work.
